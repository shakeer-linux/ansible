**Ansible**     
Ansible is Configuration Management Tool, is an open-source automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. Once installed on a control node, Ansible, which is an agentless architecture, connects to a managed node via SSH.


Ansible Installation information can aslo be found [here]( 
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html)



**Please follow below procedure for ansible installation and some tasks**


Take Two Ubuntu 14 VMâ€™s.
```sh
1. AnsibleMaster  --  IP 192.168.11.50
2. AnsibleSlave   --  IP 192.168.11.51
```

Make sure SSH package installed on both virtual machines or else install it.

```sh
root@ansilbemaster:~# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1	localhost
192.168.11.50	AnsilbeMaster
192.168.11.51	AnsilbeSlave

root@ansibleslave:~# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1	localhost
192.168.11.50   AnsilbeMaster
192.168.11.51   AnsilbeSlave
```
On Both master and slave install below packages.

```
apt-get update
apt-get install software-properties-common
apt-get install ansible
```
**Setup SSH Keys**  
Ansible primarily communicates with client nodes through SSH. While it certainly has the ability to handle password-based SSH authentication, SSH keys help keep things simple.

We can set up SSH keys in two different ways depending on whether you already have a key you want to use.

Create a New SSH Key Pair:

```sh
root@ansilbemaster:~# ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/root/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
f0:0a:2f:18:81:06:02:b8:eb:83:8a:f3:28:9e:1a:c6 root@ansilbemaster
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|*                |
|+.               |
|.o.   .          |
|o  .   o         |
| .. .   S        |
|o  o o .         |
|+E. . o          |
|*=.  .           |
|X=o              |
+-----------------+

root@ansilbemaster:~#
```

1st Method:  
Execute below command. this will copy the Master node public key will copied into remote node/client node(in .ssh/authorized_keys)
```sh
root@ansilbemaster:~# ssh-copy-id root@192.168.11.51
The authenticity of host '192.168.11.51 (192.168.11.51)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is c6:d8:17:e2:c7:7a:6a:2a:00:05:42:50:9f:75:9a:a5.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
root@192.168.11.51's password:

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'root@192.168.11.51'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```
2nd Method:  
Copy public key of master node(.ssh/id_rsa.pub) manually into the Client/Slave node file(in .ssh/authorized_keys)

```sh
root@ansilbemaster:~# ssh 192.168.11.51
